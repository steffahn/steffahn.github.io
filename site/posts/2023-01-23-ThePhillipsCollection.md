We visited the [North Carolina Museum of Art](https://ncartmuseum.org/) this past weekend where there's a [visiting exhibition](https://ncartmuseum.org/series/a-modern-vision-european-masterworks-from-the-phillips-collection/) from the [Phillips Collection](https://www.phillipscollection.org/) in Washington DC. This is a fantastic Kandinsky piece called _Succession_ from 1935 from the showing.
